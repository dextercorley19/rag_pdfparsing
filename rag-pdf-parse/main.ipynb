Place a flashlight to the side of the bowl at the bottom of the fuel filter housing and you should see clean amber diesel fuel with a little sediment . The diesel fuel may have a red die added to it so , variation of color is OK . If you see a clear colorless fluid , it is water - Call the Service shop right away .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_85: If there seems to be excessive sediment and the amber diesel fuel is cloudy , keep this in mind , you may need to switch to the backup fuel filter if the engines are not pulling enough fuel . These Racor brand fuel filters are set up in pairs ; one of the filters is active with fuel flowing through the filter to the engine . The second filter is the backup filter and ready to be used when the first filter is clogged . Between the two filter units is a valve with a handle that has a point at one end .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_86: This points toward the filter being used . If the RPM of one of the engines begins decrease , you will need to switch to the backup fuel filter . To switch fuel filters : 1 . Slow the engines down to idle and shift the engines out of gear , 2 . Have a crewmember take watch as you enter the engine room , 3 . Turn the valve handle at the front of the Racor filter so that it points toward the backup filter . The valve handle has a pointed end that points to the filter that is active .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_87: To switch , turn the valve to point to the backup filter . 4 . Check the fuel filter of the other engine , if there is excessive sediment , switch that filter as well . 5 . Let the engine idle for a minute before increasing the throttle to cruising speed Between the two filters is a vacuum gage that indicates the pressure ( vacuum ) of fuel being pulled through the filter . If the needle is in the red zone , it is time to switch to the backup fuel filter .

Prior to departure , be sure that the shore power chord is disconnected and stowed onboard . 2 . Turn the stabilizer system on and center the fins . 3 . Mooring lines should be prepared by having the bow and stern line doubled back to the boat with only a single loop around the base of the cleat or , around the dock rail . This will allow for the boat to be untied from the boat rather than from the dock .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_125: 4 . Have a roving fender at hand and ready to be deployed where needed 5 . Untie the forward and aft and spring lines 6 . When the captain calls ‘ Cast off lines , ’ flip the bow line and stern line away from the cleat and pull the line onto the boat . 7 . If the boat is in a slip , slowly back the boat out by using reverse gears of both engines . Initiate reverse with the dock-side engine , this will pull the stern slightly way from the PENALTY BOX III OPERATING MANUAL NW Explorations | 37 dock .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_126: Use reverse gear for a count of 2 and then shift the gear back to neutral . You may also push the bow away from the dock with a short burst of the bow thruster . 8 . If you are moored alongside of a dock , twist the stern away from the dock with the dockside engine in reverse and the outside engine in forward . Setting the bow line up as a spring line to prevent forward movement of the boat is helpful . 9 . When you are clear from the dock and other boats , you may maneuver as needed .\n",

As you approach the dock , turn the boat with either reverse gear of the outside engine to slow your forward motion , or forward gear of the dockside engine to add a little speed , so that with the momentum of the boat , you slide into position parallel to the dock . 8 . Use short bursts of the bow thruster to adjust the angle of approach . 9 . Use reverse gear of one engine for 1 second or less to bring the boat to a stop .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_130: 10 . Have your crew step onto the dock from the stern and tie the stern line and then walk forward to secure the bow line . 11 . When the stern is tied , you may use the bow thruster to push the bow into the dock . 12 . You may need to use one of the spring lines to slow the forward movement of the boat . 13 . Tie the spring lines after you get the boat situated onto the dock . 8.3 Close quarter Maneuvering Arctic Star has enough power to drive the boat at idle speed ; you will not need to use the throttles , only the gear shifters .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_131: With twin engines , it is easier to keep the rudders at the center position . You can steer the boat by using forward and reverse gear to twist the boat in one 38 | PENALTY BOX III OPERATING MANUAL NW Explorations direction or the other . Imagine that you are driving a grocery cart ; forward with the starboard engine will turn the boat toward the port side . Using reverse gear will accentuate the turn and slow the boat down . When you shift between forward and reverse , hold the gear shift in neutral for a count of 3 .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_132: Shifting directly between forward and reverse can damage the transmission . Take it slow . Shift in and out of gear to keep your speed and momentum in control and give you time to plan you next maneuver . You may also use the bow thruster to steer the boat with short bursts of the thruster . Plan your maneuver ahead ; have a route to the dock in mind and follow the route that brings you into the dock . You will look like a professional . 8.4 Bow Thruster A bow thruster is a wonderful tool to assist with close-quarter maneuvering .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_133: Short bursts of the thruster can help to make small adjustments the boats momentum . A push of the joystick to one direction will move the bow in that direction . The bow thruster pushes the bow to one side and since the boat will pivot at its center of lateral resistance ( the pivot point ) , the stern will move to the opposite direction ; the bow thruster can also be used to adjust the position of the stern . Use the bow thruster with short bursts so that you do over steer the boat which will require correcting with bursts of the thruster in the opposite direction .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_134: 8.5 Stabilizer Arctic Star is equipped with a Naiad hydraulic stabilizer system that controls the movement of two fins under the boat to reduce the motion of the boat in choppy sea conditions . The roll stabilizer control panel is on the overhead dashboard of the lower helm station and the breaker switches are on the 12-volt DC panel : ‘ STBL MASTER ’ and ‘ STBL PUMP ’ . This system operates with a hydraulic pump that is driven by the port engine and the system reaches its full effectiveness at cruising speed .

      "group_137: To engage the synchronizer : 1 . Bring the boat up to cruising speed . 2 . When the engines are near to the same RPM push the synchronizer toggle switch to the ‘ On ’ position and the synchronizer light will come on . 3 . Use both throttle controls to adjust the RPM as desired and the synchronizer will automatically bring the engines into synch . 4 . The synchronizer will disengage if the RPMs of the engines become too far apart . So , turn off the synchronizer before you throttle back to idle . You can engage or disengage the synchronizer from either the lower helm or the flybridge helm .\n",

Trim tab controls are next to the anchor windlass switch to the right of the helm . 40 | PENALTY BOX III OPERATING MANUAL NW Explorations 9.0 Anchoring • Anchoring • Shore tie • Rafting 9.1 Setting an Anchor For secure anchoring , choose an appropriate harbor with a soft bottom such as sand , mud , or gravel and with adequate depth so that at low tide , you will still have more than 10 feet under the keel .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_140: Cruising guides often describe the conditions of bays and harbors and give tips on where to anchor , look at the charts and chartplotter to locate any rocks , reefs , or other hazards . Then , choose the spot in the anchorage where you have room to “ swing ” without disturbing other boats . Remember , responsibility for leaving room goes to each successive boat to arrive ; the first boat to arrive in an anchorage has priority . Arctic Star has a 66-pound Bruce anchor with 350 feet of chain for the anchor rode ( Table below ) .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_141: We recommend that you anchor with a minimum scope of 4 to 1 . That is , let out 4 feet of chain for every 1 foot of depth . So , if you anchor at a depth of 25 feet , let out 100 feet of chain . The 100-foot red mark should be let out into the water , not at the anchor roller . Take the tide into account when considering your depth ; if the tide will rise overnight then add the appropriate length of chain so that you will have at enough scope when the tide is at the highest stage .\n",
      "\n",
      "group_142: If you expect more than 25 knots of wind , then let out more chain so that the scope is at 6 to 1 or more . To anchor have one crew at the helm to maneuver the boat and another at the anchor windlass at the bow . The anchor can be lowered and raised using the foot switches below the windlass or with the toggle switch on the windlass panel . To anchor : 1 . Be sure the generator should be running . 2 . Turn on the windlass switch that is to the right of the lower helm .\n",

When you have found your anchoring location , bring the boat to a stop where you want to lower the anchor with the bow into the wind . 6 . Lower the anchor to the bottom before backing away from the anchor . Anchor windlass is controlled by foot switches near the deck . The windlass handle on deck can be used to push in on the foot switch if needed .\n",

      "group_144: PENALTY BOX III OPERATING MANUAL NW Explorations | 41 7 . Continue to let out chain as the boat slowly backs away ( shifting in and out of reverse at idle RPM ) . 8 . Stop the windlass when you have reached the desired length of chain measured at the water . 9 . Continue to slowly back on the anchor by shifting in and out of reverse until the chain becomes taut and straight . The anchor is now set . Arctic Star has enough power to pull the anchor through mud and potentially break the set so , do not pull on the anchor for more than 5 seconds .\n",

The chain should be pulled straight up out of the water and your crew at the bow should let you know which direction the boat needs to be moved to keep the chain in position . As the chain is lifted by the windlass and falls into the chain locker , it piles up and may fall over onto itself and become tangled . To prevent a tangle in the chain locker , have one crewmember flake the chain from side to side to prevent it from piling up to high .\n",

The chain falls from the windlass gypsy through a hawsepipe directly below into a chain locker. An anchor washdown nozzle is permanently mounted below the anchor roller to rinse the anchor and chain as they are being raised. Washing mud off the anchor and chain keeps the anchor locker clean and reduces odor. An anchor bridle is stored in the starboard-side locker behind the Portuguese bridge along with spare lines.
